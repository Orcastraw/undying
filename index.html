      <p>Undying is working up to launching as a queer first, indie magazine based out of Seattle. Covering issues and topics pertinent to the local area, state, and nationally, our aim is to create a publication for an underserved community and tackle topics from the queer eye.</p>
      <p> Undying will be a free magazine distributed in local businesses and events in the Seattle area, and feature editorials, reviews, and writing from volunteer writers.</p>

      <h4>Our Goals: Where We're Going</h4>
      <div class="multi-column">
        <p>Undying magazine wants to be a magazine covering topics crucial to queers that aren't covered anywhere else. We're not focused on nonstop coverage of the politics that ruin our lives, but we DO want to be a magazine talking about the ways our connections and communities can protect us, what we can do to stay safe and happy in the world we find ourselves in, and what we think of it. We are undying. We are here and sticking around. And while we're here, we'd like to provide you with longform writing about the topics that interest us and the arts and highlights that make our queer communities shine.</p>

      <h4>Why Print Media</h4>
      <p>Print media is dead. It's dying and disappearing before our eyes. Does that mean it's better what we have? No. What we gain from print media is a chance to escape distraction. It's a chance to encounter contet that speaks to you and represents you without having to find a book, a game, or some other media from friends, or the internet. Print media circulates spreads and empowers, and the queer scenes of today deserve their own slice of that.</p></a><a class="item-with-image magazine with-border" href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/GRKQoKM" target="_blank">
